# An Epitech Chatbot builded with Dialogflow

This is a simple Flutter + Dialogflow app in order to lead a simple discussion
with someone about [Epitech Benin](https://epitech.bj/).

This project is based on the work on [this repository](https://github.com/VictorRancesCode/flutter_dialogflow) with some fixes I've had.
